Heyy, Vineet Poojary here, most important hing in my life?
My education and currently pursuing my bachelors in Data Science and Business Analytics and its foundation was maybe kept in 2010 when I began watching sports.
As years passed by data became so much involved in sports and this intrigued me how a data scientist works from a box and can tell so much about a game.
Focused on working hard in this field and make a good reputation and respect for myself.
CIAO.
